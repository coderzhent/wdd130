            Is this a good trip for kids? What are the age ranges you allow?
          </h2>
          <p>
            Absolutely this is a good trip for children of all ages. We have
            found however that children over the age of 8 seem to enjoy it more
            overall (And parents especially enjoy it more if their children are
            all over 8). A common concern we get from parents is that their
            children will be bored stuck on a boat for hours at a time.
            Surprisingly we deal with very few bored children of any age. The
            areas we are rafting through are some of the most beautiful in the
            world, and you never know what you might see around any corner. Not
            to mention the rapids which keep things very interesting. Each boat
            also comes equipped with a guide. It has been proven that river
            guides are unable to go for very long at all without telling
            stories...some of which are even true!
